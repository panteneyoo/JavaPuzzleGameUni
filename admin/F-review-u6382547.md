Component: <getViablePieces and it's helper functions (makePieceArray, willPieceComplete and symDif>
Author: Ziwei Liu <u6380075>

1. This code is a very well written code, with each method explained fairly well, and altogether set out well.
The best feature of the code would be the use of Sets and Hash Sets to easily add and remove elements, and the
removal of helper functions from the main body of code to stop cluttering of the code.

2. The code does have comments above all the methods which does help in the understanding of the code, but more
commenting would be beneficial to allow others to understand the code. The code can be difficult to read in some
areas.

3. The program is a little unordered, with some helper methods which are used solely in Task 6, located above and
some below Task 6.

4. The methods and variables are all properly named according to the Java convention. This style is consistent
throughout the whole code, including the helper functions.

5. As a whole, the code is very well written, with no obvious errors. The helper function willPieceComplete
is relatively small and could have been included in the main body of code getViablePiece. I understand that
the function has removed to help prevent unhelpful cluttering, but considering the small size, it might not
have been necessary.
